# HttpJsonParser
A practice android app for my Informatics 448 class to get 
familliar with Application Object, Parsing JSON, and making an HTTP request

My app is an image gallery - I chose option 2, and created a brand new 
application project in order to start fresh without the Dotify work. I created
an app that fetches JSON using Retrofit, and displays images using Glide. 

In order to fulfill the Application class data requirement, I implemented
an upvote counter, and accessed it from within my main activity.

Known Bugs:
I hardcode one value in MainActivity.kt, when I should instead dynamically generate the size
I ran into troubleshooting bugs that I did not have time to fix when I attempted to do it dynamically

If I were to put this app on the app store or something, I would fix this first.
